# Loumhelm: Empire's Imitator (Unfinished)
*THIS MOD IS NOT IN A PROPER PLAYABLE STATE*


This is my very first mod for this game.
I just downloaded it a little while ago and when I found out that you can mod it, I immediately tried to make one.

While making mods on mobile was not recommended, I did it anyway because I don't have a PC.
And now here we are.

Anyways, I plan to add:

+5-7 nations\factions
Each of these will have a great upside, but also a downside to balance things out.

+E.G. The only faction so far having more unit strength, science and gold, but has attributes that weaken the expansion of cities and reduced happiness.
I don't know if these negative attributes are actually taking effect, but if they aren't, I would gladly accept any help to fix this.


+As with any other mod, each faction will have exclusive units and buildings.
That's really all I have to say for now.
